## What it is

A plugin that maps Claude's internal states to ambient light changes. When Claude is thinking, the light shifts. When it needs your input, it glows gold. When a task completes, pale green. Errors pulse coral. Instead of jarring notifications, you get peripheral awareness — information you can sense without looking.

## Why it exists

I've been working with Claude almost daily, and the default interaction model felt off. Notifications demand attention. Alerts interrupt flow. But the work itself is collaborative — more like pair programming than delegating to a tool.

I wanted something that matched how I actually experience working with an AI: parallel processes, shared context, a rhythm of back-and-forth. Light felt right. It's ambient. It doesn't interrupt. It just *is there*, and you notice when it changes.

The setup process reflects this philosophy too — Claude interviews you about your preferences and together you design a visual language that fits your workflow. It's collaborative all the way down.

## What I learned

This was one of my first real projects built *with* Claude, not just *using* Claude. The difference matters.

Building with Claude meant treating it like a collaborator with opinions, not a tool to be commanded. I learned to prompt less and converse more. To share context generously. To iterate in dialogue rather than specifications.

The project itself is small — a few shell scripts, some JSON config — but the process changed how I think about human-AI collaboration. The best outputs came when I stopped trying to control every decision and started trusting the back-and-forth.

The meta-ness isn't lost on me: a project about ambient communication between human and AI, built through ambient collaboration with an AI, now featured on a site we built together. It feels right.
